# Hercules DJControl Starlight custom mapping

These scripts are to be used for Mixxx 2.4 with the aforementioned controller. Basically it extends a bit some functionality, while 
the code has been updated to run without warnings on Mixxx 2.4. Still, it doesn't use components extensively as it should but it 
works for now to be able to mix on the go with it. 

## What's new?

These are the adjustments done to the mapping:

1. Shift + side of the wheel: Instead of fast forwarding or backwards, displaces the selector in the track list, so you don't have to leave
   the controller to select the next track from a crate.
2. Shift + Play: Loads the selected track into the deck.
3. Shift + Bass knob: Adjusts the mids in the mixer.
4. Shift + hotcue buttons: Instead of removing the cues 1 to 4 allows to set or jump to cues 5 to 8.

## Secondary controller scripts

These scripts labeled **secondary** need refreshing, but they should work. Basically maps the Starlight to channels 3 and 4 to be used as a secondary controller
so you can have 4 physical channels running along with your main controller.
